          <p>HelloðŸ‘‹ and welcome!</p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m Anant Sahu, and Iâ€™m excited to have you here. Iâ€™m 23 years old, and I hold a degree in Civil Engineering from Jabalpur Engineering College, graduating in 2023.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing my studies, I joined JSpider, where I underwent 11 months of intensive training in full stack development. This experience honed my skills and prepared me to take on real-world projects with confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also had the opportunity to work at Eventdtl Pvt Ltd as a full stack developer. Over my 6-month tenure, I contributed to various exciting projects, gaining hands-on experience in web development and team collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to helping you with all your bike rental needs!</p>
